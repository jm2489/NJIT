# Communication Fundamentals Homework Review

## **Question 1**
### **Prompt:**
What is the minimum sampling rate required to adequately capture all information present in a signal with a maximum frequency of 8000 Hz?

### **Answer:**
- Using **Nyquist's Sampling Theorem**, the minimum sampling rate is **16,000 samples per second (16 kHz)**.
- **Explanation:**
  - Nyquist's theorem states that the sampling rate must be at least twice the maximum frequency of the signal to preserve all information.

---

## **Question 2**
### **Prompt:**
What is the minimum sampling rate required to adequately capture all information present in a signal with a maximum frequency of 22,000 Hz?

### **Answer:**
- Using **Nyquist's Sampling Theorem**, the minimum sampling rate is **44,000 samples per second (44 kHz)**.
- **Explanation:**
  - A signal with a maximum frequency of 22,000 Hz must be sampled at least twice that rate to avoid information loss.

---

## **Question 3**
### **Prompt:**
Given an antenna length of 150 m, what is the frequency it is tuned for?  
**Formula:** \( c = \lambda f \), where:
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, m/s \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 150 \, m \) (antenna length).

### **Answer:**
- **Frequency:** \( f = \frac{c}{\lambda} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{150} = 2 \times 10^6 = 2 \, \text{MHz} \).

---

## **Question 4**
### **Prompt:**
Calculate the theoretical maximum throughput for a communication channel with:  
- **Bandwidth (B):** 75 kHz,  
- **Signal levels (M):** 4.  
**Formula:** \( \text{Throughput} = 2B \log_2 M \).

### **Answer:**
- \( \log_2(4) = 2 \).  
- \( \text{Throughput} = 2 \times 75,000 \times 2 = 300,000 \, \text{bps (300 kbps)} \).

- **Signal levels (M):** 2.  
**Formula:** \( \text{Throughput} = 2B \log_2 M \).

### **Answer:**
- \( \log_2(2) = 1 \).

### **Prompt:**
Estimate the real-world throughput for a channel with:  
- **Bandwidth (B):** 25 kHz,  
- **SNR:** 30 dB.  
**Formula:** \( \text{Throughput} = B \log_2(1 + S/N) \). Convert SNR to linear ratio: \( S/N = 10^{30/10} = 1,000 \).

### **Answer:**
- \( \log_2(1 + 1,000) = \log_{10}(1,001) / \log_{10}(2) = 3.00043 / 0.30103 \approx 9.97 \).  
- \( \text{Throughput} = 25,000 \times 9.97 \approx 249,250 \, \text{bps (249.25 kbps)} \).

### **Answer:**
- \( \log_2(1 + 100,000) = \log_{10}(100,001) / \log_{10}(2) = 5.0000043 / 0.30103 \approx 16.61 \).  
- \( \text{Throughput} = 75,000 \times 16.61 \approx 1,245,750 \, \text{bps (1.245 Mbps)} \).
